                            Well, it depends on what you want from it. Knowing HTML will take only
                            a few days of reading and learning the codes for what you want. 
                            You can have the basics down in an hour. Once you know the tags you can create HTML pages

                        <p>
                            However, using HTML and designing good websites is a different story,
                            which is why I try to do more than just teach you code here at HTML Source — I 
                            like to add in as much advice as possible too. Good website design is half skill 
                            and half talent, I reckon.

                            The range of skills you will learn as a result of running your own website is impressive.
                            You’ll learn about aspects of graphic design, typography and computer programming. 
                            Your efficiency with computers in general increases.You’ll also learn about promotion and  
                            your writing will probably improve too, as you adapt to write for certain audiences.
